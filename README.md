# Lido MCP Server

The reference MCP server for Lido — making stETH staking, position management, and governance natively callable by any AI agent.

Point Claude, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible agent at this server and stake ETH from a conversation. No custom integration code needed.

## Why This Exists

AI agents need to interact with DeFi protocols, but bridging the gap between natural language and on-chain transactions is hard. You need to handle private keys, gas estimation, protocol-specific quirks (like stETH rebasing), and transaction safety — all without the agent making a costly mistake.

This MCP server solves that by giving agents a structured, safe interface to the Lido protocol:

- **Every write operation supports dry-run simulation** — agents always preview gas costs and verify transactions before executing
- **A mental model document** (`lido.skill.md`) teaches agents Lido-specific concepts before they act — rebasing mechanics, wstETH vs stETH tradeoffs, safe staking patterns
- **Position monitoring with bounds** — agents can autonomously manage staking positions within human-set parameters
- **Guided workflows via MCP prompts** — pre-built multi-step workflows for staking, withdrawing, and governance review

### Agent Mental Model (`lido.skill.md`)

A structured document that teaches AI agents Lido-specific knowledge:
- stETH rebasing mechanics and the shares model
- wstETH vs stETH tradeoffs and when to use each
- Safe staking patterns (always dry-run first)
- Withdrawal lifecycle (request → wait → claim)
- Dual governance states and what they mean for stakers
- Common mistakes to avoid (dust amounts, exact comparisons, forgetting claims)

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- An Ethereum RPC URL (Alchemy, Infura, etc.)
- A private key for the wallet that will execute transactions

### Install

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd lido-mcp-server
npm install
```

### Configure

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:
```
LIDO_RPC_URL=https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY
LIDO_PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
LIDO_CHAIN_ID=1
```

**L1 (full Lido SDK — staking, wrapping, governance):**
- `LIDO_CHAIN_ID=1` for Ethereum mainnet
- `LIDO_CHAIN_ID=17000` for Holesky testnet
- `LIDO_CHAIN_ID=560048` for Hoodi testnet (recommended for testing)

**L2 (wstETH balance queries + transfers):**
- `LIDO_CHAIN_ID=8453` for Base
- `LIDO_CHAIN_ID=10` for Optimism (also supports rebasing stETH)
- `LIDO_CHAIN_ID=42161` for Arbitrum

### Build & Run

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Connect to Claude / Cursor

Add to your MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lido": {
      "command": "bash",
      "args": ["/path/to/lido-mcp-server/start.sh"],
      "env": {
        "LIDO_RPC_URL": "https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY",
        "LIDO_PRIVATE_KEY": "0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY",
        "LIDO_CHAIN_ID": "1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Target Use Cases

### 1. Developer stakes ETH via Claude — zero integration code

```
User: "Stake 1 ETH with Lido"

Claude: Let me walk you through this safely.
  → Checks protocol status (not paused, limits ok)
  → Checks your balance (1.5 ETH available)
  → Shows current APR (3.4%, 7-day SMA 3.3%)
  → Dry-runs the transaction (gas: 0.002 ETH)
  → "Ready to stake 1 ETH. Gas cost ~0.002 ETH. Confirm?"

User: "Yes"

Claude: → Executes stake
  → "Done. TX: 0xabc... You received 1.0 stETH."
```

### 2. Agent monitors and manages position within bounds

```
User: "Monitor my Lido position. Alert me if APR drops below 3%
       or my staked amount exceeds 100 ETH."

Claude: → Calls lido_analyze_position with min_apr=3.0, max_position_eth=100
  → "Position: 85.2 ETH staked, APR 3.4%. All within bounds."

[Later, APR drops]

Claude: → Calls lido_analyze_position again
  → "⚠ APR is 2.8% — below your minimum of 3.0%.
     7-day SMA is 3.1%, suggesting this may be temporary.
     Recommend: wait 24h and re-check before withdrawing."
```

### 3. DAO contributor queries and votes on governance proposals

```
User: "Show me the latest Lido DAO votes"

Claude: → Calls lido_get_aragon_vote
  → "5 most recent votes:
     Vote #185: Open — Yea 15.2M LDO (92%), Nay 1.3M LDO (8%)
     Vote #184: Executed — passed with 98% support
     ..."

User: "Vote yes on #185"

Claude: → Calls lido_vote_on_proposal (dry_run=true)
  → "Dry run: Vote Yea on #185. You have 5,000 LDO. Gas: ~0.001 ETH. Confirm?"

User: "Yes"

Claude: → Calls lido_vote_on_proposal (dry_run=false)
  → "Done. Voted Yea on #185. TX: 0xabc..."
```

### 4. Staker signals opposition via Dual Governance

```
User: "I want to signal opposition to the latest proposal."

Claude: → Calls lido_get_governance_state
  → "Governance is in Normal state. Veto signalling is at 0.12%,
     well below the first seal threshold of 1%."
  → Dry-runs lock of 10 stETH in escrow
  → "Ready to lock 10 stETH for governance. Gas: ~0.003 ETH. Confirm?"

User: "Yes"

Claude: → Approves stETH for escrow + locks
  → "Done. 10 stETH locked in veto signalling escrow. TX: 0xdef..."
```

### 5. L2 wstETH management on Base

```
User: "Check my wstETH balance on Base"

Claude: → Calls lido_l2_get_wsteth_balance
  → "Balances on Base:
     ETH: 0.5
     wstETH: 10.0
     Note: wstETH on L2 is a bridged token whose value tracks the L1 rate."
```

**Key design decisions:**
- **Real SDK, no mocks** — all operations go through `@lidofinance/lido-ethereum-sdk` and `viem` to actual Ethereum contracts
- **Dry-run by default** — every state-changing tool defaults to `dry_run: true` (simulation only). Agents must explicitly set `dry_run: false` to execute real transactions
- **Protocol-aware errors** — raw blockchain errors (insufficient funds, reverts, nonce conflicts, stake limits, paused) are translated to human-readable messages
- **Zod validation** — all tool inputs are validated before any SDK call
- **MCP annotations** — every tool declares `readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, and `openWorldHint` so agents know which tools are safe to call without confirmation
- **Parallel queries** — tools that need multiple data points use `Promise.all` for performance
- **L2 aware** — set `LIDO_CHAIN_ID` to Base (8453), Optimism (10), or Arbitrum (42161) and the server exposes wstETH-specific tools. On Optimism, rebasing stETH tools are also available. L1-only tools (staking, governance) are excluded automatically
